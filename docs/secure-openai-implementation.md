# Secure OpenAI API Implementation

## Problem Solved

This implementation solves a critical security issue with OpenAI API usage in mobile/client applications:

1. **API Key Protection**: OpenAI automatically disables API keys that are exposed in client-side code, even when using `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`.

2. **Security Best Practice**: API keys should never be included in client-side code because they can be extracted and abused.

## Solution Architecture

We've implemented a secure proxy pattern:

```
Frontend App → Backend API → OpenAI API
```

### Key Components:

1. **Frontend (`smsAnalyzer.ts`)**:
   - No longer stores or uses OpenAI API keys
   - Makes HTTP requests to our own backend API
   - Falls back to rule-based detection if backend is unavailable

2. **Backend (`routes/openai.js`)**:
   - Securely stores the OpenAI API key in server environment variables
   - Exposes an `/analyze-sms` endpoint for SMS fraud detection
   - Handles all direct communication with OpenAI

3. **Backend Configuration**:
   - API key is stored in `token.env` file (not tracked in git)
   - The actual full key must be added to this file in production

## Developer Instructions

1. Make sure your backend is running before testing the application
2. Add your full OpenAI API key to the backend's `token.env` file
3. Do NOT add API keys directly to the frontend code
4. If backend requests fail, the system will automatically fall back to rule-based detection

## Security Benefits

- API key is never exposed to clients
- No risk of OpenAI disabling your key
- Better usage monitoring and rate limiting
- Ability to implement server-side caching for similar requests

## Fallback Mechanism

The system maintains its robustness by using rule-based detection as a fallback when:
1. The backend service is unreachable
2. OpenAI API returns errors
3. Rate limits are exceeded

This ensures that fraud detection always works, even if AI-based detection is temporarily unavailable.
